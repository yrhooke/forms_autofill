#what do we want to do:

#we want to be able to extract an fdf template from a filled in pdf
#We want template to remember from what pdf as well
#We want to be able to add fdf template to pdf to fill it.
#we want to be able to add fields to fdf template


so: 

stage 1:
1. extract fdf object from pdf
2. save fdf object
3. use existing fdf object or a file it's from to add info to pdf


stage 2: edit fdf object + standardize ways to do so.
1. create fdf template object - remembers what pdf it's from. 
2. fdf template should know which fields in fdf have same/similar information
3. have methods for auto-filling in these fields based on some input. 
4. 

stage 3: web server

stage 4: be able to add new forms easily
objects: 

pdf - a form with all the info/visuals
fdf - just the form information for a pdf

we manipulate fdf, and eventually write to pdf

what manipulation do we do to fdf?

    we change the value of some entries in fdf's @data

that's basic level

to change 1010 form we need to insert some info to the appropriate places:
    name, DOB, entry date, address, alien ID number

to do this well we want to:
    1. know what places are important - per form (1010)
    2. have a function to fill them in

let's deal with filling them in later.
